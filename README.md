# DAC2022

The Annual Data Science Competition hosted by NUS Statistics and Data Science Society (NUS SDS) was back again for its 2022 iteration. Instead of focusing on a traditional data science problem statement this year, the organizing team opted for a new format, choosing to go with the Data Analytics-based competition instead to make it more beginner friendly. This year’s competition was a great success, attracting 850 participants across 230 teams, ultimately culminating in 100 submissions and 5 top teams. This year’s competition featured a geospatial dataset graciously sponsored by Grab and participants got to work with real-life transport data across countries in the region.
